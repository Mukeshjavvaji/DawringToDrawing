A server side Machine-Learning model that can recognize a drawing across 50 million drawings of 345 categories. Use our tool to convert rookie __Dawrings__ to Computer Recognizable __Drawings__ with a click of a button.

When you draw something on the provided whiteboard, and choose to predict the doodle. Our ML model provides it's 6 best guesses to what the object is.

Our main motive was to provide a __one-click__ solution to access well made pictures from reasonable scribbles. Our inspiration was from all the online lectures we had to sit through during _lockdown_ where drawing on a computer with mouse was a hard task.

We created this project out of interest. Hopefully our idea resonates with any video conferencing company, who can implement this with even better efficiency.

- Special thanks to Google _quickdraw_ and their expansive [dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data), which was bane to our _RAM_ but boon to our outcome. Without whom, this project would'nt be possible.

- Thanks to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) that were kind enough to host our backyard project for free.
